# UOCIS322 - Project 5 - Ethan Pressley (epressle@uoregon.edu) #
Brevet time calculator with AJAX and MongoDB!

## Overview

This Docker/Flask/MongoDB application expands upon the previous project by adding a database which can be added to and viewed with two buttons at the bottom of the webpage.  
To use, simply insert your information in the form and press 'Submit'.  
If you would like to see your saved information, press 'Display' on the bottom of the form.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
If the data inserted is invalid (no data is present, negative kilometers, out of order), the data will not be inserted into the database.
